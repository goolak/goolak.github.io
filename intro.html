<p>Our history is enriched with different stories of numerous contributions that individuals have made for the progress of mankind. The efforts they have put into those works, have made us in debt to them for the sacrifices they have made towards the mankind. The role that Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642), had played in the revolution of Renaissance has proved him as a hero. Galileo was an Italian physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, and engineer who made fundamental contributions in the revolution of Renaissance by developing scientific methods. He was a relentless demolisher of Aristotelian views and criticized them effectively by recording supporting evidences which show the accuracy of his argument (Albert Van Helden, Pg. 1-2). It gave him not only controversial popularity but also sworn enemies for the rest of his life as he contradicted to the Aristotelian view about the universe and agreed with the argument that Copernicus had stated a long time ago. When he needed to choose his career, he preferred Mathematics out of all the choices he had available that time. Invention of telescope and discoveries of celestial bodies took us one step forward from the horizon, towards the evolution of a modern new world which would be based on science and technology - the world we are living in right now (Luara Fermi & Gilbert Bernadini, Page 3 - 25). </p>
