<p>The most significant quality which defines hero best would be to have the will and the strength to contribute in the society in order to make the people’s livelihood comfortable. There are many people who have more than enough wealth from which they can use a little part in the development of the society. However, they prefer to be narrow-minded and prefer to stay quiet when it comes to spend money for the welfare of mankind. Contribution doesn’t always mean to give money as donation; significant inventions for the development of the society can also be considered as contribution for greatness. Galileo had played a special role in modernizing the humankind by inventing first telescope. In 1595, he invented an improved ballistics calculation geometric and military compass, which he later improved for surveying and general calculations and earned money from tutoring on its use. In 1593, he invented early thermometer that unfortunately depended on both temperature and pressure. He published many books to raise awareness and interest about his discoveries. He showed his greatness and nobility by enhancing our life with the gift of his experiments which led the way to modern science. In exchange, all he got was humiliation and negligence. His contribution in the field of philosophy and mathematics cannot also be disregarded. All he contributed for the mankind shows his superiority and reflects heroism in his characteristics.</p>
