	<h1> What do we see hero as?</h1>
	<p> According to Merriam Webster, a hero is a person who is courageous. In contrast to the definition of the dictionary, my perspective of a hero is slightly different from them. From my point of view, being brave only meets a small segment of the criteria that is required to be a hero. I think of a hero as a person who is persistent to fight for what he/she believes regardless of the consequences he/she has to confront in the future. He/she is always deliberate to pass through any situation or adversity in terms of establishing the truth in the society even if he/she had to pay an extremely valuable price in return. A true hero must also possess the courage to endure any sort of pain in order to conquer what he/she believes as right and thus fulfills his/her duty towards the society. They put aside all the aspects they have of their life and selflessly contribute themselves in others welfare. So, basically from my perspective, the three qualities that a hero should have will be firstly, being able to fight for what he/she believes in; secondly, acting selfless by contributing in society's prosperity; and lastly, have the acknowledgement of what is best for him/her and never let go of his dream.</p>
