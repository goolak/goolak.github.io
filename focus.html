	<p>The first quality that a hero should possess would be to have the ability to stay focused on what he/she believes in. There are many cases where people have fought for what they have believed as right rather than following others footsteps. The most difficult task that they are frequently challenged with is to convince people. However, they have accomplished this hardship through their determination and self-confidence. Their strong desire and passion for their goal never let them to give up on it or part away from. My hero, Galileo Galilei wasn't any different from the other heroes in terms of obtaining his dream to establish the fact about the structure of the universe. That's why he disputed the Aristotelian view and embraced Copernicus's argument as his weapon to proof the fact which was stated a long ago. According to Aristotle, the earth is in the center of the universe and the sun as well as the other planets revolves around it. However, Copernicus said that the sun is in the center of the universe and the earth is only a planet revolving around it. Galileo's invention of telescope helped him to agree with Copernicus's idea.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, in that period, Aristotelian views were influential in the society and trying to eliminate them from the society was against the formal religion and society he was obedient to all his life. Yet, this courageous man had never been afraid of the consequences that he might have to go through. Implementing the new theory in the society had become his goal which he was adamant to accomplish. Ultimately, he was labeled as a "Rebel" for his act and had to endure a really harsh punishment: not being able to offend his own theory and also not to support Copernicus's idea (Luara Fermi & Gilbert Bernadini, Page 3 - 25). It took the church 300 years to realize that what they accused Galileo of was a mistake (History. Com Staff, Galilei is convicted of heresy,Pg.1). What he tried to do was to only enlighten people of the truth of the universe, however, he was misunderstood.</p>
